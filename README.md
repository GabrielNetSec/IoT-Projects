# “IoT Robot for Autonomous Fire Detection and Reporting” 

## Objective

Fire detection is essential for mitigating wildfire risks, particularly in areas with limited human surveillance. This
design proposal aims to develop an autonomous IoT-enabled robot capable of navigating a one-squarekilometer
area. Upon detecting a fire, the robot will transmit precise location coordinates to a remote data center,
facilitating a timely response. The design emphasizes modularity, flexibility, and efficiency, incorporating
cutting-edge sensors, actuators, and data communication technologies to provide a scalable and effective fire
detection solution adaptable to diverse environmental conditions and applications.

# “Water Tap Monitoring System”

## Objective

The project is designed and implemented to detect the status of a water tap within a
home and transmit that, through appropriate communication means, over 2 km to some remote
device. The system will return a message, "Water status On," in case of water flow, whereas in
case of a closed tap, the returned message will be "Water status Off." In this project, we have
learned how Arduino works concerning communications, including the setup of networks for the
transfer of information over long distances.

### Skills Learned

- Arduino R4 with integrated WIFI ESP32.
- Water flow sensor YF-S201.
- SIM800L GSM/GPRS Module.
